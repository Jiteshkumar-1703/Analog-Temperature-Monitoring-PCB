# Linearized Temperature Monitoring and Over-Temperature Alarm System (PCB)

## Overview
This project implements an analog temperature monitoring system using an NTC thermistor and op-amp based linearization. The circuit converts temperature variation into a near-linear voltage output and triggers an audible alarm when the temperature exceeds a preset threshold.

## Features
- NTC thermistor-based temperature sensing
- Op-amp based signal conditioning and linearization
- Comparator-based threshold detection
- Transistor-driven buzzer alarm
- 2-layer PCB designed using KiCad with ground copper pour

## Temperature Range
- 30 °C to 60 °C
- Alarm threshold set at 50 °C

## Tools Used
- KiCad (Schematic & PCB Design)
- Analog Circuit Design
- ERC & DRC verification

## Applications
- Over-temperature protection
- Industrial monitoring
- Embedded system front-end circuits
